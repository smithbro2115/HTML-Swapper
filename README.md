# HTML-Swapper
This is a project that switches one (or however many you want) html tag with another.  

The way it finds the correct tags are Rules.  A Rule can either be True or False.  I've got a few different predetermined types of rules, for example: The tag has the attribute ___ (whatever you want here... let's just say href), or the tag has the attribute ___ that equals ___ (class == edited), another one is Tag Is ___ (div).  You can use however many of these rules at the same time, the tag is required to meet all of them unless you add an OR rule.

Once you add your Rules you can set your output. You have access to all values that you specified the tag must have in the rules section,
also you will always have access to: All Attributes, All Contents, Full Tag, and Tag Type.

Please keep in mind that I'm still working on this, so it's a little rough :).  If you want to help, please feel free to report any bugs, leave issues, or any suggestion. I'm a semi new programmer and this is my first open source project,  my biggest reason for this is to learn, so I really want your opinions and suggestions!  Also feel free to contribute and submit requests.
